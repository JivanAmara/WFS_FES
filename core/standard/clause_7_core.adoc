=== Overview

include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

Figure 1 illustrates the resources supported by the Core requirements class using
UML. Each resource type available through the server is an «interface».

A server that implements the WFS API provides access to the features in a dataset.
In other words, the API is a distribution of that dataset. A file download, for example,
would be another distribution.

That is, each WFS has a single `LandingPage` (path `/`) that provides links to

* the `APIDefinition` (path `/api`),
* the `Conformance` statements (path `/conformance`),
* the `DatasetDistribution` metadata (path `/collections`).

The `APIDefinition` describes the capabilities of the server and which can be used by
clients to connect to the server or by development tools to support the
implementation of servers and clients. Accessing the `APIDefinition` using
HTTP GET returns a description of the API.

Accessing the `Conformance` using HTTP GET returns a list of URIs of
requirements classes implemented by the server.

The distribution consists of a set of feature collections. This specification does not
include any requirements how the features in the dataset have to be aggregated
into collections. A typical approach is to aggregate by feature type, but any other approach
that fits the dataset or the applications using this distribution may be used, too.

Accessing the `DatasetDistribution` using HTTP GET returns a
`DatasetDistributionResponse`, which includes a link to each `Collection`
in the distribution along with metadata about each collection:

* a local identifier for the collection that is unique within the WFS;
* a list of coordinate reference systems in which geometries may be returned by
the server, where the first one is the default coordinate reference system
(in the Core, the default is always WGS 84 with axis order longitude/latitude);
* an optional title and description for the collection;
* an optional bounding box that can be used to provide an indication of the
spatial extent of the collection - typically derived from the data.

Each `Collection` (path `/collections/{collection-name}/items`) consists of the features in the collection where each
feature in the distribution is part of exactly one collection.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/30[ISSUE 30] +
Allow also features that do not belong to any collection?

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/66[ISSUE 66] +
Support features that do belong to multiple collections?

Accessing a `Collection` using HTTP GET returns a `CollectionResponse`,
which basically consists of features in the collection. The features included
in the response are determined by the server based on parameters of the request.

A `bbox` parameter may be used to select only a subset of the features in
the collection (the features that are located in the bounding box).

The `limit` parameter may be used to request only a subset of the
selected features and to indicate that the client wants to page through
the selected features of the collection.

The `CollectionResponse` may include metadata about the number of selected and returned
features (`numberMatched` and `numberReturned`) as well as links to simplify
paging (`next` and `prev`).

Each `Feature` (path `/collections/{collection-name}/items/{feature-id}`)
is also a separate resource and may be requested individually using HTTP GET.

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/root-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a

  ]
}
----
=================

=== API definition

==== Operation

Every WFS provides an API definition that describes the capabilities
of the server and which can be used by developers to understand the API,
by software clients to connect to the server or
by development tools to support the implementation of servers and clients.

include::requirements/requirement_api-definition.adoc[]

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/api-definition-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a
response with a HTTP status code `200`.

The server SHALL return an API definition document.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/api-definition-oas +

If the API definition document uses the OpenAPI Specification 3.0,
the document SHOULD conform to the
<<rc_oas30,OpenAPI Specification 3.0 requirements class>>.
|===

If multiple API definition formats are supported by a server, use
content negotiation to select the desired representation.

The API definition document describes the API. I.e.,
there is no need to include the `/api` operation in the API definition itself.

The idea is that any WFS can be used by developers that are familiar with
the API definition language(s) supported by the server. For example, if
an OpenAPI definition is used, it should be possible to create a working
client using the OpenAPI definition. The developer may need to learn a little
bit about geometry, etc., but it should not be required to read this standard
to access the data via the API.

=== Declaration of conformance classes

==== Operation

To support "generic" clients for accessing Web Feature Services in general - and
not "just" a specific API / server, the server has to declare the
requirements classes it implements and conforms to, too.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/conformance-op +

The server SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path `/conformance`.
|===

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/conformance-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code `200`.

The content of that response SHALL be based upon the OpenAPI 3.0 schema link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/req-classes.yaml[req-classes.yaml] and
list all WFS 3.0 requirements classes that the server conforms to.

.Requirements class response document
=================
This example response in JSON is for a server that supports OpenAPI 3.0 for
the API definition and HTML and GeoJSON as encodings for features.

  ]
}
----
=================

=== HTTP 1.1

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/http +

The server SHALL conform to <<rfc2616,HTTP 1.1>>.
|===

This includes the correct use of status codes, headers, etc.

=== Web caching

Entity tags are a mechanism for web cache validation and for supporting conditional
requests to reduce network traffic. Entity tags are specified by <<rfc2616,HTTP/1.1 (RFC 2616)>>.

[[rec_etag]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/etag +

The service SHOULD support entity tags and the associated headers as
specified by HTTP/1.1.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add an example OpenAPI operation (headers, response codes). Here or in clause 9.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/38[ISSUE 38] +
More detail / examples on caching

=== Support for cross-origin requests

To access data from a HTML page where the data is on another host than
the webpage is by default prohibited for security reasons ("same-origin policy").
A typical example is a web-application accessing feature data from
multiple distributed datasets.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/cross-origin +

If the server is intended to be accessed from the browser, cross-origin
requests SHOULD be supported. Note that support can also be added in a
proxy layer on top of the server.
|===

Two common mechanisms to support cross-origin requests are:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing[Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)]
* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP[JSONP (JSON with padding)]

////
==== Support for JSONP

JSONP  ("JSON with padding") is a convenient and popular method to overcome
cross-domain restrictions. Cross-domain resources are loaded through script
injection.

[[rec_jsonp]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/jsonp +

If a request includes the parameter `f` with the value `json` and a
parameter `callback`, the response SHOULD be `{callbackValue}({originalJSONResponse});``
where `{callbackValue}` is the value of the parameter `callback` in the request
and `{originalJSONResponse}` the result of the request, if the callback parameter
had been omitted. The HTTP status code of the response SHOULD be '200'.
|===

I.e., the client may make the request with a special callback parameter and the
server responds with a JSON padded response that looks like:

```
 {callbackValue}({original_json_response});
```

NOTE:	One of the inconveniences of using JSONP is that the server always needs
to respond with an HTTP status of 200. Otherwise the browser’s network stack
rejects the response from the server, and the client callbacks are never
even called. To overcome this, the errors  should be wrapped inside the
response for requests with the `callback` parameter.

==== Support for CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a draft W3C specification that defines
ways for a web server to allow its resources to be accessed by a web page from
a different domain.

[[rec_cors]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/cors +

The service SHOULD meet all requirements of the CORS specification related
to resource authors.
|===

For example, a conforming implementation should support the configuration of
origins that are allowed to access resources of a GeoServices REST API service.
If a client submits a request using a "Origin" header that is in the list of
origin, the response will include a "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" header
with the value of the Origin header. See the CORS specification for details.

////

=== Encodings

While WFS 3.0 does not include any mandatory encoding, it recommends the following
encodings. See <<overview,Clause 6 (Overview)>> for a discussion.

[[rec_html]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/html +

To support browsing a WFS with a web browser and to enable search engines to crawl
and index a dataset, implementations SHOULD consider to support an HTML encoding.
|===

[[rec_geojson]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/geojson +

If the feature data can be represented for the intended use in GeoJSON,
implementations SHOULD consider to support GeoJSON as an
encoding for features and feature collections.
|===

<<_http_1_1,Requirement `/req/core/http`>> implies that the encoding of a server response
is determined using content negotiation as specified by the HTTP specification.

The section <<mediatypes,Media Types>> includes guidance on media types for
<<encodings,encodings>> that are specified in this document.

Note that any server that supports multiple encodings will have to support
a mechanism to mint encoding-specific URIs for resources in order to express
links, for example, to alternate representations of the same resource. This
document does not mandate any particular approach how this is supported by
the server.

As clients simply need to dereference the URI of the link, the
implementation details and the mechanism how the encoding is included in
the URI of the link are not important. Developers interested in the
approach of a particular implementation, for example, to manipulate ("hack")
URIs in the browser address bar, can study the API definition.

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
Two common approaches are:

* an additional path for each encoding of each resource (this can be expressed,
for example, using format specific suffixes like ".html");
* an additional query parameter (for example, "accept" or "f") that overrides
the Accept header of the HTTP request.
=====================================================================

=== Coordinate reference systems

As discussed in Chapter 9 of the <<SDWBP,W3C/OGC Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices>>,
how to express and share the location of features in a consistent way is one
of the most fundamental aspects of publishing geographic data and it is important
to be clear about the coordinate reference system that coordinates are in.

For the reasons discussed in the Best Practices, Web Feature Service 3.0 uses
WGS84 longitude and latitude as the default coordinate reference system.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/crs84 +

Unless the client explicitly requests a different coordinate reference system,
all spatial geometries SHALL be in the coordinate reference system
http://www.opengis.net/def/crs/OGC/1.3/CRS84 (WGS84 longitude/latitude).
|===

The Core does not specify a capability to request geometries in a different
coordinate reference system. Such a capability will be specified in another part
of the WFS 3.0 series.

=== Link headers

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/link-header +

Links included in payload of responses SHOULD also be included
as `Link` headers in the HTTP response according to <<rfc5988,RFC 5988, Clause 5>>.

This recommendation does not apply, if there are a large number of links
included in a response or a link is not known when the HTTP headers of the
response are created.
|===

=== Feature collections metadata

==== Operation

include::requirements/requirement_fc-md-op.adoc[]

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-md-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code `200`.

The content of that response SHALL be based upon the OpenAPI 3.0 schema link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/content.yaml[content.yaml].

A `200`-response SHALL include the following links in the `links` property
of the response:

* a link to this response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by
the server (relation: `alternate`),
* links to each feature collection resource in this distribution of the
dataset for each supported encoding (relation: `item`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

[[fc_md_descriptions]]
[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-md-descriptions +

If external schemas or descriptions for the dataset exist that provide
information about the structure or semantics of the data, a `200`-response
SHOULD include links to each of those resources in the `links` property
of the response (relation: `describedBy`).

The `type` link parameter SHOULD be provided for each link.

This applies to resources that describe to the whole dataset. For
resources that describe the contents of a feature collection, the
links SHOULD be set in the `links` property of the appropriate
object in the `collections` resource.

Examples for descriptions are: XML Schema, Schematron, JSON Schema,
RDF Schema, OWL, SHACL, a feature catalogue, etc.
|===

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/56[ISSUE 56] +

metadata (example in DCAT). Which link relation type?

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-md-links +

For each feature collection in this distribution of the dataset,
the `links` property SHALL include an item for each supported encoding
with a link to the collection resource (relation: `item`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` properties.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Check, if we can/should make use of the new
link:https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.1.md#linkObject[Link Object]

.Feature collection metadata response document
=================
This feature collection metadata example response in JSON is for a dataset with
a single collection "buildings". It includes links to the collection resource in all formats that
are supported by the service (link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type]: "item").

Representations of the metadata resource in other formats are referenced using link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type] "alternate".

Additional links to a GML application schema for the building data and to
a web page that has additional information about buildings are provided, too, using link:https://www.iana.org/assignments/link-relations/link-relations.xhtml[link relation type] "describedBy".

Coordinate reference system information is not provided as the service provides
geometries only in the default system (WGS84 longitude/latitude).

are only examples and MAY be changed.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-limit-response-1 +

The response SHALL not contain more features than specified by the
optional `limit` parameter. If the API definition specifies a maximum
value for `limit` parameter, the response SHALL not contain more
features than this maximum value.

Only items are counted that are on the first level of the collection.
Any nested objects contained within the explicitly requested items
SHALL not be counted.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Permission {counter:per-id}* |/per/core/fc-limit-response-2 +

The server MAY return less features than requested (but not more).

A template for the definition of the parameter in YAML according to
OpenAPI 3.0 is available at
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/parameters/limit.yaml[limit.yaml].

==== Parameter bbox

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-bbox-definition +

Each feature collection operation SHALL support a parameter `bbox`
with the following characteristics (using an OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----

----
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-bbox-response +

Only features that have a geometry that intersects the bounding box SHALL be
part of the result set, if the `bbox` parameter is provided.

The bounding box is provided as four numbers:

* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 1
* Lower left corner, coordinate axis 2
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 1
* Upper right corner, coordinate axis 2
|===

For WGS84 longitude/latitude this is in most cases the sequence of
minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude and maximum latitude.
However, in cases where the box spans the antimeridian the first value
(west-most box edge) is larger than the third value (east-most box edge).

.The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone
=================
The bounding box of the New Zealand Exclusive Economic Zone in WGS84 (from 160.6°E to 170°W and from 55.95°S to 25.89°S)
would be represented in JSON as `[ 160.6, -55.95, -170, -25.89 ]`.

|Recommendation {counter:rec-id} |/rec/core/fc-filters +

If features in the feature collection include a feature property that has a
simple value (for example, a string or integer) that is expected to be useful
for applications using the service to filter the features of the collection
based on this property, you SHOULD support a parameter with the name of the
feature property and with the following characteristics (using an
OpenAPI Specification 3.0 fragment):

[source,YAML]
----
in: query
required: false
style: form
explode: false
----

The `schema` property SHALL be the same as the definition of the feature
property in the response schema.

.An additional parameter to filter buildings based on their function
=================
[source,YAML]
----
name: function
in: query
description: >-
  Only return buildings of a particular function.\

  Default = return all buildings.
required: false
schema:
  type: string
  enum:
    - residential
    - commercial
    - public use
style: form
explode: false
example: 'function=public+use'
----
=================

.An additional parameter to filter buildings based on their name
=================
[source,YAML]
----
name: name
in: query
description: >-
  Only return buildings with a particular name. Use '*' as a wildcard.\

  Default = return all buildings.
required: false
schema:
  type: string
style: form
explode: false
example: 'name=A*'
----

For string-valued properties, servers could support wildcard searches. The
example included in the OpenAPI fragment would search for all buildings with
a name that starts with "A".

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-response +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code `200`.
|===

The response will only include features selected by the request.

The number of features returned depends on the server and the parameter `limit`:

* The client can request a limit it is interested in.
* The server likely has a default value for the limit, and a maximum limit.
* If the server has any more results available than it returns (the
number it returns is less than or equal to the requested/default/maximum limit)
then the server will include a link to the next set of results.

So (using the default/maximum values of 10/10000 from the OpenAPI
fragment in requirement `/req/core/fc-limit-definition`):

* If you ask for 10, you will get 0 to 10 (as requested) and a `next` link,
if there are more.
* If you don't specify a limit, you will get 0 to 10 (default) and a `next` link,
if there are more.
* If you ask for 50000, you might get up to 10000 (server-limited) and a `next`
link, if there are more.
* If you follow the next link from the previous response, you might get up
to 10000 additional features and a `next` link, if there are more.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-links +

A `200`-response SHALL include the following links:

* a link to this response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported
by the service (relation: `alternate`).
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |/rec/core/fc-next-1 +

A `200`-response SHOULD include a link to the next "page" (relation: `next`),
if more features have been selected than returned in the response.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |/rec/core/fc-next-2 +

Dereferencing a `next` link SHOULD return additional features from the
set of selected features that have not yet been returned.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Recommendation {counter:rec-id}* |/rec/core/fc-next-2 +

The number of features in a response to a `next` link SHOULD follow the
same rules as for the response to the original query and again include
a `next` link, if there are more features in the selection that have
not yet been returned.
|===

This document does not mandate any specific implementation approach for
the `next` links.

An implementation could use opaque links that are managed by the server.
It is up to the server to determine how long these links can be de-referenced.
Clients should be prepared to receive a 404 response.

Another implementation approach is to use an implementation-specific parameter
like the `startIndex` parameter that was used in previous versions of WFS (and
which may be added again in an extension to this specification).

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Permission {counter:per-id}* |/per/core/fc-prev +

A response to a `next` link MAY include a `prev` link to the resource that
included the `next` link.
|===

Providing `prev` links supports navigating back and forth between pages,
but depending on the implementation approach it may be complex to implement.

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-rel-type +

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

NOTE: The representation of the links in the payload will depend on the encoding
of the feature collection.

.Links
=================
If the request is to return building features and "10" is the default `limit`,
the links in the response could be (in this example represented as link headers
and using an additional parameter `startIndex` to implement `next` links - and
the optional `prev` links):

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.html>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?startIndex=10>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----

Following the `next` link could return:

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?startIndex=10>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.html?startIndex=10>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?startIndex=0>; rel="prev"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?startIndex=20>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----

If an explicit `limit` of "50" is used, the links in the response could be:

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?limit=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.html?limit=50>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?limit=50&startIndex=50>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"
----

Following the `next` link could return:

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?limit=50&startIndex=50>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.html?limit=50&startIndex=50>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?limit=50&startIndex=0>; rel="prev"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json?limit=50&startIndex=100>; rel="next"; type="application/geo+json"

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/fc-timeStamp +

A `200`-response SHALL include a property `timeStamp` based upon the schema
link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/timeStamp.yaml[timeStamp.yaml].
|===

.link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/master/core/openapi/schemas/timeStamp.yaml[Schema for the timeStamp property]

----
timeStamp:
  description: This property indicates the time and date when the response was generated.
  type: string
  format: dateTime
  example: '2017-08-17T08:05:32Z'
----
////

[NOTE]
=====================================================================
TODO +
Add normative statements for the following information in the response:

* timeStamp: Indicates the time and date when the response was generated.
* numberMatched: The number of features of the feature type that match the
selection parameters like `bbox` or additional filter parameters.
* numberReturned: If the value is provided, the value shall be identical to the number
of items in the "features" array. A server may omit this information in a response,
if the information about the number of features is not known or difficult to compute.
If the value of the resultType parameter is set to "hits",
the value shall be set to "0", if provided.
=====================================================================

CAUTION: Related to link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/8[ISSUE 8] +
Define these as headers or include them in the payload? `timeStamp`, for example, does
not seem to be needed given the 'Date' HTTP header. For `numberMatched` and
`numberReturned` headers do not seem to be a good idea as, for example,
`numberReturned` can only be included at the end, if streaming is used.

=== Feature

==== Operation

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-op +

For every feature in a feature collection (path `/collections/{name}/items`),
the service SHALL support the HTTP GET operation at the path
`/collections/{name}/items/{id}`.

`name` is the property of the same name in the feature collection metadata.

`id` is the unique identifier of the feature within the dataset.
|===

NOTE: TODO +
Add more about the feature identifiers.

CAUTION: link:https://github.com/opengeospatial/WFS_FES/issues/47[ISSUE 47] +
There are two types of Feature Identifier and we need to make sure we
distinguish between them.

==== Response

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-success +

A successful execution of the operation SHALL be reported as a response with a
HTTP status code `200`.
|===

[width="90%",cols="2,6a"]
|===
|*Requirement {counter:req-id}* |/req/core/f-links +

A `200`-response SHALL include the following links in the response:

* a link to the response document (relation: `self`),
* a link to the response document in every other media type supported by the service (relation: `alternate`), and
* a link to the feature collection that contains this feature (relation: `collection`).

All links SHALL include the `rel` and `type` link parameters.
|===

NOTE: The representation of the links in the payload will depend on the encoding
of the feature collection.

.Links
=================
The links in a feature could be (in this example represented as link headers):

[source]
----
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items/123.json>; rel="self"; type="application/geo+json"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items/123.html>; rel="alternate"; type="text/html"
Link: <http://data.example.org/collections/buildings/items.json>; rel="collection"; type="application/geo+json"
----
